This project uses a thermistor, a pic microcontroller and a 7 segment display.

Open the project MAIN_READ_TEMP.X in MPLABX IDE. There , under "sources" you have a main.c
You can see how to use the library "LIB_Temperature_sensor.X" in your projects.

I have a youtube video on how to make a temerature sensor with  NTC thermistor and a PIC 18f microcontroller
